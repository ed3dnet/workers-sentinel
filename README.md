# Workers Sentinel

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** This is a toy project and a very poor imitation of Sentry. It doesn't even represent 0.1% of all Sentry features. This should not be taken seriously or used in any production environment where you actually care about error tracking. Please use the real [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for production workloads.

Workers Sentinel is a lightweight, self-hosted error tracking and monitoring solution that runs entirely on your Cloudflare account. It accepts events using the Sentry SDK wire format, allowing you to use existing Sentry SDKs by simply changing the DSN endpoint. All your error data is stored securely in SQLite-backed Durable Objects, giving you full control over your information.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying Workers Sentinel, make sure you have:

- **Cloudflare Account** - [Sign up for free](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- **Node.js 20+** - For local development (not required for one-click deployment)

**Cloudflare Services Used:**
- Workers (Compute)
- Durable Objects with SQLite (State management)
- Workers Assets (Dashboard hosting)

All these services have generous free tiers sufficient for most use cases.

## Getting Started

### One-Click Deploy

Use the "Deploy to Cloudflare" button above, or run:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template=https://github.com/G4brym/workers-sentinel/tree/main/template
```

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/G4brym/workers-sentinel.git
cd workers-sentinel

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build and deploy
pnpm deploy
```

### Local Development (guarded supervisor)

Run the full stack locally under Workerd — no Cloudflare account or credentials needed:

```bash
just install            # pnpm install across the workspace (mise pins node/pnpm/just via mise.toml)
just dev-up             # foreground local supervisor: dashboard + worker + Durable Objects on 127.0.0.1
just send-demo-events   # seed a demo user/project/events to see ingestion and grouping
just dev-down           # authenticated stop from another terminal
```

The supervisor (in `_devenv/cloudflare/`) is loopback-only, persists Durable Object state under `_devenv/cloudflare/.state/`, and strips Cloudflare credentials from child processes so local development cannot reach your Cloudflare account. See AGENTS.md for the full command list and the stale-state reconciliation runbook.

### First-Time Setup

1. **Deploy your worker** to Cloudflare
2. **Visit your worker URL** in a browser
3. **Register the first user** - this becomes your admin account
4. **Create your first project** - you'll receive a DSN
5. **Configure your Sentry SDK** with the DSN

## SDK Configuration

Workers Sentinel accepts events from official Sentry SDKs — it speaks the Sentry **ingestion** protocol (envelope and legacy store endpoints, DSN auth). Simply use your Sentinel DSN instead of a Sentry DSN.

The management/fetch API (`/api/projects/…`) is a native JSON API, **not** a Sentry-compatible one: `sentry-cli` is not supported, and compatibility with Sentry's `/api/0/` REST surface is an explicit non-goal. See AGENTS.md ("Native API reference (fetch-side)") for the real contract — pagination, attachment endpoints and drop reasons, event-id normalization, and auth scopes.

### Cloudflare Workers (Service Binding with RPC)

For Cloudflare Workers, you can use [service bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/) with RPC for optimal performance. This routes requests internally within Cloudflare's network, avoiding external HTTP roundtrips and reducing latency.

**Step 1:** Add a service binding to your worker's `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "my-worker",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_als"],
  "services": [
    { "binding": "SENTINEL", "service": "workers-sentinel", "entrypoint": "SentinelRpc" }
  ]
}
```

**Step 2:** Initialize Sentry with the RPC transport:

```typescript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/cloudflare';
import { waitUntil } from 'cloudflare:workers';

const DSN = 'https://<public_key>@<your-worker>.workers.dev/<project_id>';

export default Sentry.withSentry(
  (env: Env) => ({
    dsn: DSN,
    transport: () => ({
      send: async (envelope) => {
        const rpcPromise = env.SENTINEL.captureEnvelope(DSN, envelope);
        waitUntil(rpcPromise);
        const result = await rpcPromise;
        return { statusCode: result.status };
      },
      flush: async () => true,
    }),
  }),
  {
    async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
      // Your worker code here
      return new Response('Hello!');
    },
  }
);
```

The `waitUntil` call ensures the RPC completes even after the HTTP response returns. The `captureEnvelope` method takes the DSN and envelope, handling authentication and ingestion internally.

### JavaScript / Browser

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'https://<public_key>@<your-worker>.workers.dev/<project_id>',
});
```

### Node.js

```javascript
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'https://<public_key>@<your-worker>.workers.dev/<project_id>',
});
```

### Python

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="https://<public_key>@<your-worker>.workers.dev/<project_id>",
)
```

### Go

```go
import "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"

sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
    Dsn: "https://<public_key>@<your-worker>.workers.dev/<project_id>",
})
```

The DSN is displayed when you create a project in the dashboard, or you can find it in the project settings.

## Webhook Notifications

Workers Sentinel can send a POST request to any HTTP endpoint when a new issue is detected. This enables integration with Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, or any custom alerting system.

### Setup

1. Go to **Project Settings** in the dashboard
2. Enter your webhook URL in the **Webhook Notifications** section
3. Click **Save**
4. Use **Send Test** to verify the endpoint receives notifications

Webhook URLs must use HTTPS.

### Payload Format

When a new issue is detected, Workers Sentinel sends a JSON POST request:

```json
{
  "text": "[My App] New error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined in app.js",
  "project": {
    "id": "project-uuid",
    "name": "My App",
    "slug": "my-app"
  },
  "issue": {
    "id": "issue-uuid",
    "title": "TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined",
    "level": "error",
    "culprit": "app.js"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

The `text` field is formatted for direct use with Slack Incoming Webhooks. For Discord, use the same URL format with `/slack` appended to your Discord webhook URL.

### Notes

- Webhooks fire only for **new** issues (first occurrence of a unique error fingerprint)
- Delivery is best-effort — failures are logged but not retried
- Webhook requests are sent asynchronously and never slow down event ingestion

## Managing Team Members

Workers Sentinel supports sharing projects with other registered users through role-based access control.

### Roles

- **Owner** — The project creator. Full access, cannot be removed or changed.
- **Admin** — Can manage members (add, remove, change roles) and update project settings.
- **Member** — Can view the project, its issues, and events.

### Adding Members

1. Go to **Project Settings** in the dashboard
2. Scroll to the **Team Members** section
3. Enter the user's email address and select a role
4. Click **Add**

Users must register an account before they can be added to a project. There is no invitation system — members are added by their registered email address.

## API Tokens

API tokens allow programmatic access to the Workers Sentinel API — useful for CI/CD pipelines, scripts, custom dashboards, and integrations with incident management tools.

### Creating a Token

1. Go to **Project Settings** in the dashboard
2. Click **Manage API Tokens** in the API Tokens section
3. Enter a token name (e.g., `ci-pipeline`) and an optional expiration date
4. Click **Create Token**
5. **Copy the token immediately** — it will only be shown once

### Using a Token

Include the token in the `Authorization` header of any API request:

```bash
# List projects
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer wst_your_token_here" \
  https://your-sentinel.workers.dev/api/projects

# Get issues for a project
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer wst_your_token_here" \
  https://your-sentinel.workers.dev/api/projects/my-app/issues

# List events for an issue
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer wst_your_token_here" \
  https://your-sentinel.workers.dev/api/projects/my-app/issues/issue-uuid/events
```

API tokens use the `wst_` prefix and work alongside existing session-based authentication.

### Token Management

- **Expiration**: Tokens can be created with an optional expiration date. Expired tokens are automatically rejected.
- **Revocation**: Revoke tokens from the API Tokens dashboard page. Revoked tokens stop working immediately.
- **Limits**: Each user can have up to 10 active API tokens.
- **Audit**: Each token's Last Used timestamp is updated on each successful request.

### Security Best Practices

- Store tokens in environment variables, never in source code
- Use descriptive names so you can identify which token belongs to which service
- Set expiration dates for tokens used in temporary or rotating access scenarios
- Revoke tokens immediately when they are no longer needed or may be compromised
- Token management (creating, listing, revoking) requires session authentication — a compromised API token cannot create new tokens

## Architecture

Workers Sentinel is built with modern web technologies:

**Backend (Worker):**
- **Hono** - Fast, lightweight web framework
- **Cloudflare Durable Objects** - Distributed state with SQLite storage
- **Sentry Envelope Parser** - Compatible with Sentry SDK wire format

**Frontend (Dashboard):**
- **Vue.js 3** - Progressive JavaScript framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Pinia** - State management
- **Vite** - Fast build tooling

**Data Architecture:**
- **AuthState DO** (singleton) - Users, sessions, project registry
- **ProjectState DO** (per-project) - Issues, events, statistics

Each project has its own isolated Durable Object with SQLite storage, ensuring data isolation and scalability.

**Rate Limiting:**
- Per-project configurable hourly event quotas stored in the ProjectState DO
- In-memory counter with persistent backup in SQLite for fast O(1) checks
- Returns HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` header when quota is exceeded — Sentry SDKs handle this gracefully
- Default is unlimited (0); configurable via dashboard or `PATCH /api/projects/:slug`
